FTL(Flash Translation Layer) for low-memory embedded systems

## Introduction
Welcome to the esFtl Flash Translation Layer project! This software is designed to manage and optimize data storage on flash-based embedded devices with capacities of up to 128 MB. FTL is a critical component of modern flash storage systems, ensuring efficient data management, wear leveling, and performance optimization.

## Features

- Efficient flash memory management.
- Wear leveling algorithms for extending the lifespan of flash storage.
- Bad block management.
- Performance optimization through data placement strategies.
- Highly customizable and extensible architecture.

## Getting Started

It has been successfully tested on devices with STM32 chipsets and MT29F1G01 flash memory. If your setup matches this combination, you should find it easy to use. However, if you have a different hardware configuration, you may need to implement a new disk solution tailored to your specific requirements. A sample implementation can be found in the repository for reference.
